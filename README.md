### Please add all ideas that come to mind here. No matter how trivial, they are welcome!

- Add a filter to only display planets with a habitability probability input, e.g., only those with a 3-5% chance of being habitable.
- Add background music and sound effects for transitions?

### From here on, this is an easy-to-understand summary of all the contents in the [Details](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/navigator-for-the-habitable-worlds-observatory-hwo-mapping-the-characterizable-exoplanets-in-our-galaxy/?tab=details) section of the HWO topic.

## Challenge Overview
Your challenge is to develop an app that enables users to visualize the observational paths across our galaxy to the known exoplanets in the solar neighborhood as a function of their potential for characterization by HWO.

## Background
- Exoplanets are primarily discovered using indirect methods.
- HWO aims to directly image exoplanets and broaden the knowledge of Earth-like bodies.
- When planning the HWO mission, it is crucial to understand how the parameters of the telescope affect the parameters of observable planets.
- One method to achieve this is to visualize currently known exoplanets and observe what is visible depending on the telescope's parameters. Specifically, two aspects can be considered:
  - (1) The farther the exoplanetary system is, the fainter the central star, while the distance between the central star and the planet decreases.
  - (2) The larger the telescope's aperture, the better its ability to separate the central star from the exoplanet.

## Objectives
- Create an app that visualizes known exoplanets considering their likelihood of being observable by HWO.
- Show which exoplanets are currently visible and which new exoplanets become detectable when changing one or more telescope parameters.
- Demonstrate the potential performance of HWO to telescope stakeholders.
- Add the following features:
  - (1) Show telescope observations based on parameters.
  - (2) Display changes when specific parameters are altered.
  - (3) Group exoplanet clusters based on observational difficulty, considering factors like orbits around stars and stellar classifications.
  - (4) Include a feature that categorizes stars into easily observable and challenging observable categories for user understanding.

## Possible Considerations
- Target Audience: Various NASA stakeholders, e.g., citizens, politicians, managers.
- Add the following features:
  - (1) Show how changing telescope or equipment parameters affects observational results.
  - (2) Distinguish 'similarities between stars' and 'observability by HWO' based on exoplanet or central star parameters, visually represented in color on the cosmic display.
  - (3) Make it user-interactive: Allow users to adjust multiple parameters during observations.
